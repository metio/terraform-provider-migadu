# migadu_identity (Resource)

Provides an identity to an existing mailbox.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "migadu_identity" "example" {
  domain_name = "example.com"
  local_part  = "some-mailbox"
  identity    = "some-identity"
  name        = "Some Name"
}

# international domain names are supported
resource "migadu_identity" "idn" {
  domain_name = "bücher.example"
  local_part  = "some-mailbox"
  identity    = "some-identity"
  name        = "Some Name"
}

# Sender persona, not used for authentication
resource "migadu_identity" "sender_persona" {
  domain_name  = "example.com"
  local_part   = "some-mailbox"
  identity     = "some-identity"
  name         = "Some Name"
  password_use = "none" # use mailbox user/password
}

# alternative address linked to the same mailbox
resource "migadu_identity" "mailbox" {
  domain_name  = "example.com"
  local_part   = "some-mailbox"
  identity     = "some-identity"
  name         = "Some Name"
  password_use = "mailbox" # use identity user and mailbox password
}

# application specific password
resource "migadu_identity" "custom" {
  domain_name  = "example.com"
  local_part   = "some-mailbox"
  identity     = "some-identity"
  name         = "Some Name"
  password_use = "custom" # use identity user/password
  password     = "Sup3r_s3cr3T"
}

## Schema

### Required

- `domain_name` (String) The domain name of the mailbox/identity.
- `identity` (String) The local part of the identity.
- `local_part` (String) The local part of the mailbox that owns the identity.
- `name` (String) The name of the identity.

### Optional

- `footer_active` (Boolean) Whether the footer of the identity is active.
- `footer_html_body` (String) The footer of the identity in `text/html` format.
- `footer_plain_body` (String) The footer of the identity in `text/plain` format.
- `may_access_imap` (Boolean) Whether the identity is allowed to use IMAP.
- `may_access_manage_sieve` (Boolean) Whether the identity is allowed to manage the mail sieve.
- `may_access_pop3` (Boolean) Whether the identity is allowed to use POP3.
- `may_receive` (Boolean) Whether the identity is allowed to receive emails.
- `may_send` (Boolean) Whether the identity is allowed to send emails.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password of the identity.
- `password_use` (String) Configures the password use of the identity. Use `none` if you just need to be able to send using a specific `From` identity, but still authenticate with the mailbox address and password. Use `mailbox` if you want an alternative address but linked to the same mailbox using the same password. Use `custom` if you need an application specific password (e.g. your phone), shared mailbox with individual passwords or sandboxing of accounts for specific services.

### Read-Only

- `address` (String) Contains the email address of the identity `identity@domain_name` as returned by the Migadu API. The Migadu API always returns the punycode version of a domain.
- `id` (String) Contains the value `local_part@domain_name/identity`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# migadu_identity resources can be imported by specifying the local part,
# the domain name, and the identity to import.
terraform import migadu_identity.identity 'local_part@domain_name/identity'
```
